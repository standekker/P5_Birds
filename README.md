# P5_Birds
A P5 test program that simulates some kind of bird behavior. It's my first try with JavaScript, trying to update it on the go.

## Introduction
My first GitHub repo created with P5, a JavaScript libary for Processing
  https://p5js.org/
  https://processing.org/
Huge thanks to Danial Schiffman and his awesome YT channel, The Coding Train: https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman

## Demo
In  the future i want a live demo on my own personal website, but for now you just have to download the repo and do it yourself.
1. Download the repo.
2. Browse to the index.html and open it with your browser
3. click and see magic happen!

If you wanna see the debug mode, just dive into the code sketch.js and find DEBUG = false; , somewhere near the top.
